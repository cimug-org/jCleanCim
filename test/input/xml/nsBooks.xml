    This XML example has three namespaces declared in the root element and one declared on an element
    deeper in the structure. The element 'booklist' has three children, all named 'book'. But the first
    child has the namespace 'science', while the following children have the namespace 'fiction'. This
    means that these elements are completely different to XPath.
