  </h2>
  <hr />

  <h3>New home</h3>
  <p>
    Since 2016, jCleanCim has new home at my <a href="http://www.tanjakostic.org/jcleancim">web
      space</a> - which is accessible also to non-CIMug members.
  </p>

  <h3>New features</h3>

  <h4>Hyperlinks in the Word document</h4>
  <p>
    <em><b>Credit</b>: Prototype by Laurent Guise (thanks!) has inspired the implementation in
      this release.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    This (by IEC 61850 community) long awaited feature is in and it is controlled by a new
    configuration option,
    <code>docgen.word.useHyperlinks</code>
    . To not incure performance penalty, the default is 'disabled' (i.e., you need to set it to
    <code>true</code>
    explicitly .
  </p>
  <p>The hyperlinks are introduced for those classes and enumeration literals that have been
    printed in the same document. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For CIM editors, hyperlinks to IdentifiedObject will be printed only in IEC 61970-301,
      all the other CIM canonical model documents will not have hyperlinks to IdentifiedObject.</li>
    <li>For IEC 61850 editors, hyperlinks to e.g., INT32 will be printed only in IEC 61850-7-2
      (where INT32 is defined), while in IEC 61850-7-3 there will be no hyperlinks to INT32. Another
      example, because we print in several annexes presence conditions, DA, CDC and LN tables will
      all have presence conditions (except for M and O) hyperlinked.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>New MS Word document placeholders</h4>
  <p>In this release, we have added three new placeholders for MS Word document generation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>startUmlClass.{packageName.className}.endUml</code>: This was on request by IEC
      61850 community, but is generally useful if you want to quickly print a couple of classes
      only. You don't need to modify the UML model (to put them into a package) only to be able to
      print them. However, please do not misuse the feature to end up with a proliferation of
      individual class placeholders (it is always wiser and better maintainable to mainly include
      full packages).</li>
    <li><code>startUmlDiagNote{packageName}.{diagramName}.endUml</code>: We added this for a
      custom document generation, where we want to have a table with two columns: diagram in one
      column, its description in the other. Feature is now available, so you can experiment with
      your own layouts if you need.</li>
    <li>See below IEC 61850-specific features for the third new placeholder.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We have also added examples in the base-small-template.docx to show how to use the new
    placeholders.</p>

  <h4>Support for EA Enumeration type (that discards class with "enumeration" stereotype)</h4>
  <p>In more recent versions of EA, on XMI import, EA refuses to import the original class with
    stereotype "enumeration", but transforms it automatically to the new Enumeration type. We found
    no way to force EA to keep enumeration stereotype imported through XMI. The result was that the
    enumeration classes were then not recognised in jCleanCim as enumerated types and one had to
    manually add enumeration stereotype.</p>
  <p>This release provides proper handling for this case, as well - i.e., the EA Enumeration
    type is now recognised as enumerated type, the same way as a class with "enumeration"
    stereotype.</p>

  <h3>Performance changes in release 02v01</h3>
  <p>None. Note however that newer versions of Enterprise Architect seem to always be somewhat
    slower than the older ones (we noticed the slow down in diagram generation).</p>

  <h3>Potential backwards compatibility breaking changes for the application user</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Before this release, we have been outputing Web Access XML documentation for elements
      and diagrams by default and only as HTML (text with mark-up), while the default for MS Word
      was raw text, without markup. To consistently support choice for printing markup or not in
      both MS Word and Web Access XML, the configuration option <code>docgen.word.printHtml</code>
      has been renamed to <code>docgen.printHtml</code>, incidating that this choice is not anymore
      limited to MS Word. By default, the value remains <code>false</code>, which means no change
      for MS Word output, but change for Web Access XML output (now printing raw text instead of
      markup). <b>Note:</b> Enabling markup for MS Word still does NOT work properly (and probably
      never will), so it is wise to stay with the default.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Potential forwards incompatibility for the application user: old jCleanCim with new EA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>-</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other functional changes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>builder.ea: Improved identification and signaling of the problematic entries in
      messages "+++ EA problem: attr count on ..." (when reading EA model); e.g. "+++ attr Adp: pos
      = 14 <i>DUPLICATE</i>". Moving any one of the entries ending with <i>DUPLICATE</i> should
      initiate EA's renumbering and solve the problem for the class. Note that this has been applied
      in the previous release for everything but class attributes and operations (now we fixed those
      as well).
    </li>
    <li>docgen.collector: Improved generation of locally and globally unique IDs.</li>
    <li>model: Support for mutual dependencies without going into infinite recursion.</li>
    <li>model: Added EA "Process" as recognised skipped element, for some custom extensions.</li>
    <li>CIM-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IEC61850-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>model: Per IEC 61850-7-3 editor request, replaced "ARRAY of min...max of XYZ" with
          "ARRAY min...max OF XYZ".</li>
        <li>stats: Improved logging of Abbreviated terms usage section, now alphabetically
          ordered.</li>
        <li>collector: Enabled support for CDC ERY of IEC 61850-7-420 (it was implemented since
          a while but for some reason commented out... Thanks to L. Guise for investigating the
          issue!)</li>
        <li>collector: Added a dedicated Word placeholder <code>startUmlIec61850NsName.{className}.endUml</code>
          to allow correct printing of derived IEC 61850 name space name. Word API didn't behave as
          expected. If there are no separator between placeholders, it doesnâ€™t recognise a
          placeholder, so we either miss a piece of information or need to introduce the space
          character between e.g. '2007' and 'B'. This is not to be acceptable for namespace.name, so
          this new placeholder is the clean resolution for the issue.
        </li>
        <li>model: To derive Namespace "Needs" for Web Access XML, we now collect all the
          containing package dependencies, in addition to any native one. This allows us to have,
          e.g. subpackages of WG17 (7-420 and 90-8) get derived the hand-drawn dependencies of the
          containing package (WG17) to 7-2, 7-3, 7-4.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Validation rules:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>util (validation): -</li>
    <li>New common / general validation rules:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New CIM-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New IEC61850-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>Iec61850LNClassesWithSuperfluousConstraints (to catch constraint for inexisting DO;
          typical copy/paste error, or consequence of DO renaming)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>collector (61850): Brought back printing default value for an FCDA (attribute in CDC).</li>
    <li>main: Fixed NPE when launching with arguments -help or -version (thanks to Jacob Dall
      for reporting).</li>
    <li>builder.ea: Now catching exceptions during EA processing and properly closing .eap
      file.</li>
    <li>builder.ea: While building dependencies from EA, now retaining only those linking
      directly package-2-package or class-2-class (class, interface, enum); all other dependencies
      are created as a skipped connector.</li>
    <li>collector (xml): In XML output, now printing properly 'this' side of association end
      for inherited association (thanks to Laurent Guise for reporting).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Known issues / limitations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>nothing new.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Implementation and packaging:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>collector, writer: split placeholder functionality to two classes.</li>
    <li>model, collector: added some more unit tests.</li>
    <li>writer: started adapting Caption class for non-English MS Word, not finished yet...</li>
    <li>upgraded libraries: n/a.</li>
    <li>all sources: updated copyright year.</li>
    <li>moved code to a new svn, which resulted into rejuvenated svn IDs (had to discard the
      history due to space limitation)</li>
    <li>added Apache POI jar; implementation far away from finished...</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Documentation:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>updated the presentation.</li>
    <li>added description on how to use a custom config.properties file.</li>

  <h2>
    <a id="02v00">Release notes for jCleanCim-02v00, 2015-05-19</a>
  </h2>
  <hr />

  <h3>Licensing changes</h3>
  <p>
    From this release, the license terms have changed, see <a href="readme.html#discl">disclaimer</a>. There
    should be no big impact if you were using it the same way as I did :-)
  </p>

  <h3>Distribution changes</h3>
  <p>Producing the distribution "Eclipse project archive jCleanCim-[version]-eclipse.zip" has
    been discontinued, because it's a manual and time consuming process. The same functionality is
    available by using the "Source distribution jCleanCim-[version]-src.zip" - by importing simply
    the eclipse project file from un unzipped directory.</p>

  <h3>New features</h3>
  <p>This is a release with incremental changes and no "real" new feature.</p>

  <h3>Performance improvements in release 02v00</h3>
  <p>None.</p>

  <h3>Potential backwards compatibility breaking changes for the application user</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>validation: Renamed rule ClassesWithSuperclassesFromUnallowed<b>Package</b> to
      ClassesWithSuperclassesFromUnallowed<b>Owner</b> to better reflect the intent (and also to
      better align with the new rule applying to attributes of a class - see below).
    </li>
    <li>all: If you have been using source code or the .jar as a library, the root package name
      has changed in this release.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Potential forwards incompatibility for the application user: old jCleanCim with new EA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>jCleanCim releases older than 02v00 may have a problem when closing .eap file with
      Enterprise Architect 12 and higher. The reason is that EA12 Java API changed (they removed a
      method that was used in the code just before closing the .eap file; and jCleanCim-02v00
      replaces that method call appropriately). In our test installation (EA12 + jCleanCim-01v10),
      there was a pop-up window telling that EA application stopped running and clicking on "Close"
      application did a smooth shut down of EA - then the run continues normally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other functional changes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>builder.ea: Improved identification and signaling of the problematic entries in
      messages "+++ EA ordering problem for ..." (when reading EA model); e.g. "+++ class
      ExciterType: pos = 22 <i>DUPLICATE</i>". Moving any one of the entries ending with <i>DUPLICATE</i>
      should initiate EA's renumbering and solve the problem in that given scope (e.g., package for
      ordering problem with its diagrams or classes, class for ordering problem with its
      attributes).
    </li>
    <li>CIM-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IEC61850-specific (as usual):
      <ul>
        <li>config61850.properties: adjusted some changed package names from UML and added
          ACSITypesEnums.</li>
        <li>model, docgen: added support for one more stereotype (structured) and the
          corresponding non-meta-model type (with prefix S_) - this is at present a kludge to obtain
          in the Word what the editors want to see.</li>
        <li>docgen.writer.xml: adapted schema to accept structured type in 7-2 (credit to Chris
          Frei).</li>
        <li>model, collector: extended usage of 'scl:emptyValue' tag not only for enum literal,
          but also for any IEC61850 attribute (specifically needed for Unit.multiplier), to simply
          override the default value ('none') with an empty string. Good luck, IEC61850 model
          managers!</li>
        <li>collector: on request of 7-2/7-3 editors, replaced the table column text "M/O/C"
          with 'PresCond".</li>
        <li>collector: on request of 7-2/7-3 editors, simplified printing of enumerated types
          in 7-2 and 7-3: instead of "ENUMERATED (XyzKind)" or "CODED ENUM (XyzKind)", now printing
          simply "XyzKind".</li>
        <li>collector: implemented support for SCL enumeration printing to use the package name
          in the heading (to allow printing a couple of packages one after another); in older
          version, we were always printing a single package in an annex; now we can print any number
          of enum packages (as SCL enums) anywhere.</li>
        <li>model, collector; on request of 7-3 editors, added "datId = " in the table title
          for all data attribute types (ConstructedDAs).</li>
        <li>collector: on request of 7-4 editors, change â€˜enumeration literalâ€™ in table
          headings / captions to â€œenumeration itemâ€?.</li>
        <li>collector: on request of 7-4 editors, donâ€™t output the package name in table
          captions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Validation rules:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>util (validation): generalised CimAttributesNameShouldBeSingular to accept anything
      ending with 'ous' and 'ius' as singular (e.g., instantaneous, previous, anonymous, radius);
      with 'bias'; with 'rans' (for Trans(ient) and Subtrans(ient)).</li>
    <li>New common / general validation rules:
      <ul>
        <li>AttributesWithTypeFromUnallowedPackage (for associations, this is already checked
          with AssociationsWithWrongSource)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New CIM-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Removed CIM-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>EnumLiteralsWithInitValue, because CIM also now allows codes for literals.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New IEC61850-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>stats: distinguishing "61850" enum literal from "any" enum literal.</li>
    <li>model (61850): distinguishing the case where presence condition literal with argument
      is used as-is, without instantiating the argument with a value (misuse of e.g. AtLeastOne(n)
      instead of AtLeastOne(1)) - credits to Chris Frei for pointing out the bug.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Known issues / limitations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>nothing new.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Implementation and packaging:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>upgraded IECDomain.xsd to 0.13.</li>
    <li>upgraded jackcess library to 2.1.0.</li>
    <li>upgraded EA dll and jar to version 12 (from EA build 1212).</li>
    <li>removed docx4j and dependencies, will try to use Apache POI instead at some later date.</li>
    <li>added some more unit tests.</li>
    <li>included oldReleaseNotes.html for distribution in the build script.</li>

  <h3>New features</h3>

  <p>This release does not introduce big new features, just a couple of formatting changes (for
    document generation), and a couple of new validation rules. For details, see the sections below.</p>

  <h3>Performance improvements in release 01v10</h3>

  <p>None.</p>

  <h3>Potential backwards compatibility breaking changes for the application user</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Every figure in an IEC document has a numbered caption. IEC editors usually request
      that there is a reference to the figure number somewhere within the text. Until this release,
      we were printing in MS Word documents so called "introduction" to the figure just before the
      figure; the intent was - well - to introduce the figure that follows. Some editors found this
      totally useless and preferred to push that "reference to the caption / figure number"
      somewhere else, i.e., below the figure. Now, below the figure, we print documentation for the
      figure (diagram note from UML). To keep that documentation independent from the dynamically
      calculated number (for the figure caption), we are now just prepending the "Figure #: " to the
      figure doc. This is, from release 01v10, the default format. If you want to preserve the old
      format, set the newly introduced configuration option <code>docgen.word.introToFigureBefore=true</code>
      . See slide #49 in the tutorial <code>doc/jCleanCimIntro.pptx.</code>
    </li>
    <li>In this release, we support printing codes for enumeration literals in CIM as well (for
      IEC61850, this was always the case). So, in CIM Word documents, tables for enumerated types
      now have three columns (the column for code is inserted). In agreement with CIM model
      managers, there is no option to preserve the old behaviour. See below for additional
      "helpers", in the application log (statistics must be enabled: <code>statistics.on =
        true</code>).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other functional changes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>docgen: when printing package, now creating the systematic "General" subclause for
      package own content (description and diagrams) only if the package has no sub-packages or
      classes.</li>
    <li>model: now parsing the initial value in enum literals (when defined) and making it
      available as integer (if parsable as integer), otherwise it's just a string.</li>
    <li>model: now logging with enumerated types that have codes all those codes used, in
      alphabetical order (generated in the *-detailed.log); this should make it easier to spot which
      codes are "free" to use.</li>
    <li>CIM-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>docgen: enum type's literals can have code (like literal's value in 61850).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IEC61850-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>docgen: when printing 7-3 CDC tables, renamed "CDC-ID" to use "cdcId", the same as
          the tagged value name in UML and added support for printing "cdcId" for abstract
          superclasses when tag is defined.</li>
        <li>model, validation: added definition for UML.PREF_DOName_Ieee and now skipping DO
          name validation with respect to abbreviaitons if the name starts with "Ieee"; only logging
          at TRACE level.</li>
        <li>updated header text for CDC tables and removed specials when printing the title of
          CDC groups (packages), as per decisions of the Editors meeting in Baden, January 2014.</li>
        <li>collector: for functions table in 7-4 (relation to part 5), implemented sorting on
          the column with the 7-4 LN name(s) for easier reference, as per decisions of the Editors
          meeting in Baden, January 2014.</li>
        <li>collector: for ARRAY formatting in 7-3, removed 'OF []' from the printed string, as
          per decisions of the Editors.</li>
        <li>collector: for CDC table heading and reference in 7-3, simplified formatting to use
          normal text, like for any class attribute.</li>
        <li>stats: now logging also the inverse of DO decomposition, i.e., the abbreviated
          terms and their usage (term: "who uses me"); in the log, search for section "Abbreviated
          terms usage". This is useful in the context of DO abbreviations sanity check, to get a
          fast overview of all references to a given abbreviation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Validation rules:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>New common / general validation rules:
      <ul>
        <li>EnumClassesWithDuplicateCodes</li>
        <li>EnumClassesWithSomeCodesMissing</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New CIM-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New IEC61850-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>Iec61850DOAbbreviationLiteralsDuplicateDescription</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>minor: validation action description in one rule.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Known issues / limitations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>nothing new.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Implementation and packaging:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>added some more unit tests.</li>
    <li>non-eclipse source distribution now includes also the two eclipse project files, so you
      can simply unzip the -src distribution and "Import-&gt;Existing project" into eclipse
      workspace (without the hassle of specific eclipse archive). Note: advantage is that you can
      also have that unzipped distribution anywhere on the disk, not necessarily within an eclipse
      workspace.</li>
    <li>updated SSJavaCOM.dll of EA with versions coming with EA11.</li>

    <a id="01v09">Release notes for jCleanCim-01v09, 2013-05-11</a>
  </h2>
  <hr />

  <p>The main focus for this release was on validation, and some formatting specials for
    IEC61850 document generation.</p>

  <h3>New features</h3>

  <h4>Validation report available as .csv</h4>

  <p>
    If you are keen on keeping your model clean (the initial very purpose of this application), then
    you'll appreciate the new validation report, now generated every time you run with validation
    enabled. The report gets stored in the project's
    <code>output</code>
    directory as a comma-separated file
    <code>problemsReport-[model-name].csv</code>
    . You can then open it with a spreadsheet application, format as you like and do filtering of
    model issues found.
  </p>

  <h4>Disabling logging of ellapsed time</h4>

  <p>
    From this release it is possible to control the time logging aspect of the run by means of the
    new configuration option
    <code>app.skipTiming</code>
    . When set to
    <code>true</code>
    , the ellapsed time currently logged upon completion of the major steps will not be logged
    anymore. So, instead of e.g.:
  </p>
  <pre>
  [main] INFO  time=[0:00:10.250] completed all configured steps - exiting
  </pre>
  <p>the log will look so:</p>
  <pre>
  [main] INFO  completed all configured steps - exiting
  </pre>
  <p>This may be useful to allow for seemless text comparison of two consecutive runs of the
    application, such as when you e.g. apply changes to the model and re-run validation or
    statistics, then want to compare the two log runs.</p>
  <p>By default, the timing of major steps gets logged as usual.</p>

  <h3>Performance improvements in release 01v09</h3>

  <p>There are two places with performance improvements in this release, but they are probably
    not very noticeable, because the task duration initially was of the order of seconds or below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generation of the XML (Web access) documentation: We have replaced the implementation
      based on dom4j/jaxen libraries with the standard Java's JAX-P. Thus, we have two dependencies
      less, and the XML doc generation for both CIM and IEC61850 models is now 2-4 times faster.</li>
    <li>(IEC61850 only) Handling of abbreviations: We have fixed some logic there and decreased
      the number of method invocations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Potential backwards compatibility breaking changes for the application user</h3>
  <p>None. The only difference in configuration file that you may notice is that only a small
    number of rules has been kept as ignored (to decrease the noise until important problems get
    fixed). In every case, you should try to fix the existing reported problems, then remove the
    ignored rules from the configuration file one by one (and fix those problems).</p>

  <p>Note that from this release, you will need Java 7 or higher.</p>

  <h3>Other functional changes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>docgen.collector: now retaining association end only if it is named.</li>
    <li>validation: now logging at DEBUG level (detailed log) all the validation rules split
      per model nature to which they apply, along with their category and severity; search for
      string "Available rules". This is useful for pasting into a presentation slide, or into a UML
      model management document.</li>
    <li>CIM-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>none</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IEC61850-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>updated Web access schema to version 0.12 (thanks to Chris Frei) to support
          minVal/maxVal on an attribute within packed list - triggered by the resolution of
          [wg10-0591 / Tissue 813]. Contains also support for CDC-ID on CDCs, etc.</li>
        <li>model, docgen: Added support for specials with the two DOs mandatory in the derived
          statistics context.</li>
        <li>validation: Added more description (including WG) when logging violation of
          Iec61850DOAttributesWithTooLongName and Iec61850ClassesWithInvalidConstraints.</li>
        <li>statistics: Added logging for name decomposition of all the DOs including the
          description of the DO itself (for easy cross-check of consistency).</li>
        <li>model, docgen: Added special printing for setting CDCs with both UML name and
          CDC-ID.</li>
        <li>model, docgen: Added support for old name (currently used for some primitive
          types).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Validation rules:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>made uniform handling for missing doc, bad doc start/end for attributes and association
      ends (while excluding associations, because we never document associations), diagrams,
      packages, attributes, classes, operations, operation parameters and return values.</li>
    <li>"smarter" filtering of allowed characters in tokens in general (e.g., to allow in some
      case underscore or dash, and forbid it in other cases).</li>
    <li>adapted rule PackageUnexpectedElements to ignore any content in the package called
      'DetailedDiagrams' (this is what we use as "parking" for content hidden from any document
      generation)</li>
    <li>New validation rules:
      <ul>
        <li>DependenciesWithUnallowedStereotype</li>
        <li>OperationsWithUnallowedTagNames</li>
        <li>OperationParametersWithUnallowedTagNames</li>
        <li>OperationParametersWithUnallowedStereotype</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New CIM-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>CimClassesNameStartingWithLowerCase</li>
        <li>CimAttributesNameStartingWithUpperCase</li>
        <li>CimAssociationEndsNameStartingWithLowerCase</li>
        <li>CimAssociationEndsNameShouldBePlural</li>
        <li>CimAssociationEndsNameShouldBeSingular</li>
        <li>CimClassesNameShouldBeSingular</li>
        <li>CimAttributesWithBadCharacterInName</li>
        <li>CimAttributesNameShouldBeSingular</li>
        <li>CimAttributesNameShouldNotStartWithClassName</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New IEC61850-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>Iec61850LNClassesInWrongGroup</li>
        <li>Iec61850LNClassesMalformedName</li>
        <li>Iec61850AbbreviationLiteralsNameStartingWithLowerCase</li>
        <li>Iec61850AttributesWithBadCharacterInName</li>
        <li>Iec61850DOAttributesNameStartingWithLowerCase</li>
        <li>Iec61850DOAttributesWithNameMissingAbbreviation (replaced
          Iec61850DOAttributesWithInvalidName)</li>
        <li>Iec61850DOAbbreviationLiteralsDuplicateName (replaced
          Iec61850DOAbbreviationLiteralsDuplicateDefinition)</li>
        <li>Iec61850ConditionLiteralsNeverUsedAsConstraints (replaced
          Iec61850ConditionEnumsWithLiteralsNeverUsedAsConstraints)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>builder.ea.db/sqlxml: Fixed NPE crash in the method <code>initRoleTagsPerConnectorUuid</code>,
      reported by Pat Brown to appear when reading the ENTSO-E profile model <a
      href="http://cimug.ucaiug.org/Groups/ENTSO-E_IOP/SDO_2013/Shared%20Documents/Profile/v2.4.2%20-%205%20March%202013/ENTSOE_v2_4_2_iec61970cim16v18_iec61968cim12v06a_iec62325cim02v07.zip">ENTSOE_v2_4_2</a>,
      (generated by CimContextor) with <code>model.builder = sqlxml/db</code>. Reason for NPE: EA
      seems to store in the connector tags table tags not only for association ends, but also for
      unknown and impossible-to-deduce-or-find connector(s)... Now we can handle that.
    </li>
    <li>collector, writer: Fixed order of columns and width for custom association ends
      printing (this may happen when option to print inheritance from meta-model is enabled). Also,
      now printing simply multiplicity, like for default association (and not M/O/C - this is not
      really defined for relationships, such as in meta-model on 61850-7-2).</li>
    <li>validation: (for IEC61850 only) Improved performance for validation related to
      abbreviations: now doing sorting of all abbreviated terms only once, before the loop on all
      abbreviations (instead within that loop).</li>
    <li>model: (for IEC61850 only) For case of same abbreviated term defined in multiple
      places, and with different description, now correctly concatenating all the descriptions
      (instead of overwriting the older ones).</li>
    <li>model: Fixed logic in some static methods in AbstractUmlObject related to duplicate
      name search and reporting; also improved performance (more compact implementation).</li>
    <li>builder: Now logging "n/a" when model built with 'db' option (without EA API).</li>
    <li>validation: Fixed abbreviation processing when DO name contains a number.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Known issues / limitations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>MS Word and XML doc generation are mutually exclusive. In other words, you have to
      provide <em>either</em> the MS Word file names <em>or</em> XML file names through
      configuration options. If required, in some future release, we may support generation of it
      all. However, the time required for MS Word doc generation is huge (minutes or tenths of
      minutes) as compared to XML doc generation (seconds).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Implementation and packaging:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>added some more unit tests.</li>
    <li>(IEC61850) fully reimplemented abbreviations handling and validation.</li>
    <li>replaced use of dom4j/jaxen with the standard jvm's JAX-P. What a hell this API - this
      was certainly design by committee, not for developers! But it's standard java and we could
      remove two dependencies; and our XML doc generation for both CIM and IEC61850 models is now
      2-4 times faster.</li>
    <li>fully adapted all validation rules to handle structured validation errors.</li>
    <li>moved non-completed builders' code into <code>experimental</code> package.
    </li>

  <p>Note: Version 01v08 should have been called -beta and it has not been released, but was
    used to generate auto-docs of various 61850 documents in last 2 weeks (plans were to release
    that one, but with lack of time, the deadline has been missed...). Below, I use 01v08 to refer
    to this 01v08a as well, and 01v08a only for the fixes applied the day of this official release.</p>

  <h4>New features</h4>

  <h5>Selective XMI format export</h5>

  <p>
    We have added the means to configure which XMI formats to export, by setting the new
    configuration option
    <code>xmiexport.dialects</code>
    to one or more comma-separated values. If nothing is specified, we keep the (almost) default
    behaviour, to export XMI files in all supported formats, except for
    <code>cimtool</code>
    ; see config.properties for recognised values.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Note: The reason to not export <code>cimtool</code> by default along with others is that
      CIMTool latest releases (1.9.6+) simply don't require .xmi file anymore, and can work directly
      with the .eap model file. Also, the CIM model exported as .xmi has more than 80MB, so we can
      be more network and disk friendly. If you however need to export it, just specify it in the
      new configuration option <code>xmiexport.dialects</code>.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h5>
    <a id="db">Fast loading of .eap file (if no need to export diagrams or XMI)</a>
  </h5>

  <p>
    We have added as an option, an extremely fast implementation for reading the .eap model file
    (thanks to Arnold deVos for the hint on a pure java library for reading M$ Access files: <a
      href="http://jackcess.sourceforge.net/">Jackcess</a>). Our big standard UML models can now
    load in a couple of seconds, and this functionality is completely independent of the Enterprise
    Architect libraries. Consequently, this is totally platform independent and can run on any OS.
  </p>
  <p>
    The limitation of this new implementation is that we <i>cannot</i> export diagrams or XMI,
    because those exports are performed by the EA repository API (not used with this
    implementation). Still, most of the time, you'll be doing model edit-validate-fix cycles, and
    this new implementation supports perfectly that use case: you can validate very quickly what you
    just edited.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to support the switch among now three possible implementations for the .eap model
    loading, we decided to replace the boolean configuration option
    <code>model.useSql</code>
    from 01v07 with the new option:
    <code>model.builder</code>
    , which can take one of three values:
    <code>db, sqlxml or japi</code>
    . Table below gives a couple of characteristics to facilitate the choice of appropriate builder
    for your actual task.
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th><code>model.builder=</code></th>

  <h4>Performance improvements in release 01v08</h4>
  <p>
    <b>B-I-G !</b>
  </p>
  <p>The following numbers have been traced from runs on Lenovo ThinkPad T410 (i5 CPU, 3GB
    memory), 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise Edition, Office 2010, Enterprise Architect 9, 32-bit Java
    1.7.0_13.</p>
  <p>The first improvement is related to reading data from .eap UML repository:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>model.builder=db</code>: This is the rocket fast option.</li>
    <li><code>model.builder=sqlxml</code> (equivalent of <code>model.useSql=true</code> of
      01v07): Speed of bulk queries here has also been improved (e,g, 4 sec in 01v08 vs. 14 sec in
      01v07). However, this is not so significant in the light of the time it takes to complete
      everything else through the EA API: open file, initialise repository, diagram export when <code>docgen.on=true</code>
      .</li>
    <li><code>model.builder=japi</code>. Finally, for the original EA API-based implementation,
      there is no improvement possible on our side, until Sparx decides to do something about it for
      the sake of its users.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that for diagram export (
    <code>docgen.on=true</code>
    ), it takes the same time with both
    <code>model.builder=sqlxml</code>
    and
    <code>model.builder=japi</code>
    , i.e., some 100-300ms per normative diagram exported.
  </p>

  <p>Performance for MS Word document generation has been significantly improved for very large
    documents with non-formatted tables (thanks to Andre Maizener's tip on ctrl-F11 !). This will
    work only on the template that has been saved as native Office 2007/2010 document (.docx),
    without compatibility enabled, because in this case only, it is possible to programmatically
    disable field updates.</p>
  <p>However, for documents with fancy table formatting (and very large tables), there is very
    little performance improvement (beauty costs :-).</p>
  <p>Note that the "magic number" 12 is not anymore magic. We have found best numbers for our
    running environment, but you may want to try other numbers that may be better for your local
    running environment (until we complete the new implementation, based on working with simple XML
    instead of COM API).</p>

  <p>* jCleanCim-01v07 does not support printing tracking CDC's attributes (special FC), so
    there are some 15 tables that are much smaller when printing with 01v07 than with 01v08.</p>
  <p>** This document is relatively small, so the cumulative effect of appending tables does now
    have time to show up.</p>

      option <code>model.useSql</code> in favour of choice option <code>model.builder</code>:
      <ul>
        <li><code>model.builder=db</code> (or empty, or null) is the new default, because
          fastest, and because it's suitable for quick validation and statistics printing, as well
          as for diagram-less MS Word or XML document generation.</li>
        <li><code>model.builder=sqlxml</code> is equivalent of <code>model.useSql=true</code>
          from 01v07. Use it when packing a release (with XMI exports) or generating documentation
          (with full diagrams export).</li>
        <li><code>model.builder=japi</code> is the equivalent of the old default; you will most
          likely never anymore need to use this one (but we keep it in case Sparx changes one day
          their underlying database schema - so we can still work before supporting new shema; or
          Sparx fulfils the expectation of their many customers and provides a rocket fast
          implementation of the API)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>With 01v08, we have started, but not finished, the new MS Word document generation
      implementation, in order to reduce time required for this task. This new implementation will
      be documented when fully implemented. In the meantime, ensure you use a new onfiguration
      option <code>docgen.word.useDocFormat</code> set to <code>true</code>. The intent for setting
      (the-still-to-come) new feature as default is because we anticipate a huge performance gain,
      and in the future, there should be no reason to fall back to the extremely slow COM API-based
      implementation.
    </li>

  <h4>Other functional changes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>docgen.word: now uniformly printing deprecated as part of description for all UML
      elements.</li>
    <li>docgen.word: now logging detailed table-generation times at debug level (detailed log).</li>
    <li>builder.ea: now catching and logging to screen the duplicate EA GUID when present in
      the model (base-small.eap contains the example of the base CIM16v14 to exercise the logging).
      Log starts like this: <code>ERROR +++ EA consistency error - duplicate EA GUID:</code>. In
      this release, it is just logged with model building (later on, we may provide a validator).
    </li>
    <li>CIM-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IEC61850-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>docgen.xml: Added support for web-access schema version=0.11, for printing empty
          literals where required by SCL, and the (previously) forgotten identifier and text for
          those presence conditions that have (condID) argument.</li>
        <li>docgen.word: Implemented the logic for new presence condition (na) in the
          derived-statistic context, for every DO in an LN not-inheriting from StatisticsLN (if you
          don't understand this sentence, don't worry, you're not the only one; the statistics model
          is just inherently not understandable at all and we hope to be able to fix it in Ed.3).</li>
        <li>docgen.*: Now printing empty string for document generation in Word, as well as XML
          (01v08a) in case of a literal with <code>scl:emptyValue</code> tagged value (email
          exchange with 7-3 editors on October 8, 2012).
        </li>
        <li>docgen.xml: Now printing in XML doc the text of condID (presence conditions
          argument).</li>
        <li>docgen.word, docgen.xml: Added support for printing tracking data attributes
          (FC=SR) just before description attributes.</li>
        <li>docgen.word: Removed printing of the text (description) for all presence conditions
          every time they are used; kept only the table where they are first defined, as well as the
          condID text for machine non-processable presence conditions only.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>New validation rules:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>ClassesWithRootPropSet; works only with <code>model.builder</code> other than <code>japi</code>,
      because the EA API does not provide a method to query whether root UML property is set.
    </li>
    <li>CIM-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>-</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IEC61850-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>Iec61850ClassesWithMissingCondIDTextInConstraints</li>
        <li>Iec61850FCDAAttributesWithMissingConstraint: This is the maxId/minId constraint on
          multi-valued attributes within CDCs</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>builder: now correctly reading connector alias if <code>model.builder</code> different
      from <code>japi</code>.
    </li>
    <li>builder: now correctly reading multiple stereotypes on association ends if <code>model.builder</code>
      different from <code>japi</code>.
    </li>
    <li>docgen.xml: now correctly printing package subtitle in XML documentation.</li>
    <li>docgen.collector: (bug submitted by Christoph Fleischer - thanx !) fixed NPE if
      constraint missing/null from multi-valued attribute.</li>
    <li>model, statistics: now classifying correctly CIM attributes whose type is enumeration.</li>
    <li>(01v08a) builder, validation: (bug submitted by Pat Brown - thanx !) when a class
      embedded into another class has an association, the builder was throwing NPE on the
      association with that embedded class; this has now been fixed, and the old validation rule
      about embedded class consequently works properly (base-small.eap, class Strawberry :-).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Known issues / limitations:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>MS Word and XML doc generation are mutually exclusive. In other words, you have to
      provide <em>either</em> the MS Word file names <em>or</em> XML file names through
      configuration options. If required, in some future release, we may support generation of it
      all. However, the time required for MS Word doc generation is huge (minutes or tenths of
      minutes) as compared to XML doc generation (seconds).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Implementation and packaging:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>added jars for jackcess and docx4j (and their respective dependencies) and removed
      dependency on apache commons-lang3 (using simply commons-lang, requred by both jackcess and
      docx4j).</li>
    <li>started replacing use of dom4j/jaxen with the standard jvm's JAX-P.</li>
    <li>updated jars for newer versions of log4j and UMLGraph (distribution build)</li>
    <li>updated IECDomain.xsd (web-access schema) to version=0.11.</li>
    <li>builder.ea: heavilly refactored the package and its sub-packages to clearly split EA
      API dependant code from pure platform-independent Java code; and to use literally the same
      implementation of SQL result-set based initialisation of the model with either EA repository
      (SQL+XML) or without it (Access DB).</li>
    <li>docgen.collector: centralised constructor logging level for implementations of <code>AbstractObjectDoc</code>
      and by default disabled it (instead of the previous trace level = was very chatty and was
      generating tonnes of detailed log traces).
    </li>
    <li>common, util: moved some classes into new package <code>util</code>.

  <h4>New features</h4>

  <h5>Fast EA model reading</h5>
  <p>In this release, we tried again to improve performance, because our standard UML models
    grow and the COM APIs (EA and MS Word) are terribly slow.</p>
  <p>
    On EA side, we introduced a new configuration option
    <code>
      <b>model.useSql</b>
    </code>
    that is false/empty by default, so it does not change the previous behaviour. When set to true,
    we use SQL bulk queries and process the returned XML dataset with XPath, instead of calling the
    EA API methods with their extremely slow collections and chatty SQL queries. This improves the
    performance of reading the model from EA repository <em>for an order of magnitude</em> - see
    numbers in the performance section below. The speed up is a bit less significant when document
    generation is enabled, because this new implementation does not concern diagram export (which is
    inherently slow: 300 - 500 ms per diagram).
  </p>

  <h5>Exporting XMI files</h5>
  <p>
    This is a new top level feature (sibling to validation, statistics and doc generation), and is
    introduced with the new configuration property
    <code>xmiexport.on</code>
    that is false/empty by default, so it does not change the previous behaviour (and because this
    takes time: EA is very slow at exporting to XMI in every set-up).
  </p>
  <p>
    As a CIM model manager, you can set
    <code>xmiexport.on=true</code>
    once you're ready to publish the release (i.e., you've done editing of the model and other
    files, fixed validation warnings and errors, etc.). Instead of the error-prone manual exporting
    3 XMI files (in different XMI formats) from within an open instance of Enterprise Architect,
    this option will result in an automatic export of those XMI files. The principle for the output
    files is similar to what we do for document generation: if the XMI files already exist in the
    ./output directory, they are backed up and the .xmi is saved in a new file. When done, you just
    need to copy these 3 .xmi files into your release directory.
  </p>
  <p>For IEC61850 UML model managers, at present there is no need to do any XMI export, because
    we don't have profiling like in CIM, and those who want to see some UML seem to be happy with
    Enterprise Architect. Still, this option will generate the same 3 XMI exports as for CIM models
    (i.e., there is no option to select only one format, or one name space, or similar).</p>

  <h4>Performance improvements in release 01v07</h4>
  <p>
    Release 01v07 does contain a full new implementation of alternative way of initialising
    in-memory model from Enterprise Architect: instead of using simply the API, we now do the bulk
    SQL queries, and initialise the model from the returned XML data by using XPath. Performance
    improvement is huge, at a cost of potential need to trick the EA model: see <a
      href="#eaErrorOrdering">EA ordering errors</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following numbers have been traced from runs on Lenovo ThinkPad T410 (i5 CPU, 3GB memory), <b>64-bit</b>
    Windows 7 Enterprise Edition, Office 2010, Enterprise Architect 9, 32-bit Java <b>1.7.0_05</b>.
    Performance has been significantly improved for reading from EA file; there are no changes in
    timing for MS Word document generation (yet):

  <h4>Potential backwards compatibility breaking changes for the application user</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>model.builder.ea: Previously, we were exporting literally all the diagrams when <code>docgen.on=true</code>.
      From this release, we export only normative and documentation diagrams, and not informative
      ones (unless the corresponding configuration option is set, for debugging purposes). This
      makes it faster to read the EA model and export only those diagrams that ever may be used in
      the documents.
    </li>
    <li>config, model.builder.ea: We have removed configuration option <code>model.picsRelpath</code>
      that allowed to specify an arbitrary relative path under which to save diagrams exported from
      UML, in case document generation is enabled. This flexibility for paths made it hard to
      process relative paths for correct inclusion of relative URL into XML output documents, while
      preserving the knowledge of the absolute path (as required for saving exported diagrams and
      for their pasting into MS Word document). So, now the place for diagram export has been fixed
      to the previous default location - project's ./output/pics/ directory. All the other behaviour
      is as before, i.e:
      <ul>
        <li>if doc generation is with an .xml output file, pics are not removed after exiting
          the application, because we need them to accompany the generated XML documents; for MS
          Word output file, we remove diagrams, because they are already included in the generated
          document.</li>
        <li>ensure you remove from time to time the backup copies of the ./output/pics
          directory (the same way you do with other backup copies of output files).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Other functional changes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>application: we log the time for EA initialisation, and the total application time</li>
    <li>common: timing logs start with the string "time[" so you can search for checkpoints</li>
    <li>builder.ea: we log the time that EA methods take to export UML diagrams.</li>
    <li>builder.ea: finally found the way to fetch the type and name of connector ends.</li>
    <li>stats: we now log on the console all tagged values with all the UML objects defining
      it; this used be logged at DEBUG level in 01v06, now it's INFO (and visible on the console).</li>
    <li>model: added support to recognise Object diagram.</li>
    <li>model: now logging also owner when validating/printing association ends.</li>
    <li>CIM-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>validation: we now allow CIM class as well to contain boundary, because
          IEC61970::Dynamics package has many diagrams with boundaries (hard to beleive, but EA
          seams to store diagram element boundary within a class...)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IEC61850-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>model, collector, docgen, IECDomain.xsd: as resolution for wg10-0491, added support
          for new stereotypes (statistics for CDCs, admin for LNs) and additional ds presence
          conditions for DOs.</li>
        <li>collector: decreased width for 7-3 CDC tables' columns TrgOp and M/O/C for
          wg10-0440.</li>

  <h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>builder.ea: now adding the attribute/operation that has duplicate position (before,
      they were overwritten).</li>
    <li>docgen.writer.xml: now correctly including internal ID as a part of fabricated
      reference for the -doc.xml file (instead of just '0'); this ensures uniqueness of entries in
      that file.</li>
    <li>docgen.writer.xml: now correctly writing only native properties' alias and aliasID and
      not inherited ones (same as for desc and descID; otherwise, we have duplicate -doc.xml
      entries).</li>
    <li>model: (IEC 61850) now correctly determining type for some abstract IEC61850 classes of
      the sample base-small.eap file (instead of deducing 'unknown' type); consequently, former
      -spec.xml errors are not applicable anymore when file generated.</li>
    <li>builder.ea: now correctly dealing with all stereotypes, while ignoring duplicate ones.</li>
    <li>docgen.writer.xml: fixed relative path for diagrams in the generated -spec.xml file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Known issues / limitations:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>MS Word and XML doc generation are mutually exclusive. In other words, you have to
      provide <em>either</em> the MS Word file names <em>or</em> XML file names through
      configuration options. If required, in some future release, we may support generation of it
      all. However, the time required for MS Word doc generation is huge (minutes or tenths of
      minutes) as compared to XML doc generation (seconds).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Implementation and packaging:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>builder, common: On the forum, somebody wrote that apparently EA goes through the
      clipboard internally even when exporting diagram to file, so I thought clipboard only may be
      faster and implemented the possiblity to use EA's export of a .bmp file to clipboard then
      saving that .bmp for pasting into Word/link for XML. However, performance-wise, it's a bit
      slower than the original EA's export to .png file: for ~100 diagrams of the base-small.eap, it
      takes ~3 seconds more. Therefore, I just kept the original export to .png file as faster.</li>
    <li>updated jars and dlls for newer versions of EA (934) and jacob (jacob-1.17-M2-x86)</li>
    <li>builder: Full new implementation of reading from EA by using SQL bulk query on tables
      of interest, and processing returned XML with XPath.</li>
    <li>build.xml ant file: added explicit target compatibility for binaries to Java 1.6
      (because we develop on Java 1.7), to ensure the binary distribution will work on both 1.6 and
      1.7.</li>

  <h4>New features</h4>
  <p>This release has a fully functional new feature: XML documentation generation for both IEC
    61850 and CIM name spaces. This feature was driven by IEC 61850 needs, and we provided an
    implementation for CIM as well (this part was trivial :-). The XML schema is included in the
    distribution, in the ./input directory. One schema (IECDomain.xsd) has been defined, to generate
    2 XML instance files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IECDomainDoc.xml contains all the translatable documentation content, such as
      class/attribute/diagram documentation, titles, captions and similar. It is extremely simple,
      with just one kind of element per name space: <code>Doc</code>. That element has an <code>id</code>
      attribute, and the mixed content text.
    </li>
    <li>IECDomainSpec.xml contains "pure" specification; it never gets translated and contains
      normative strings, as used for generation of various implementation artefacts. In addition, it
      contains a lot of meta-data relevant for document generation, including references (<code>Doc.id</code>)
      to the above-mentioned <code>Doc</code> elements from the pure documentation file.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This split makes it possible to have a relatively lean specification exported to one XML
    file, with the separate pure documentation content available in one or more XML files, one per
    language. We obviously produce the default documentation in English, from the UML model, but the
    translators can produce any number of translated replicas that would all go in-line with a
    single specification XML file.</p>
  <p>
    The schema provides support for both IEC 61850 name spaces (the way they are defined in IEC
    61850-7-1) and their CIM counterparts (simply deduced from existing CIM Version classes), and by
    default the XML files are generated for anything found in the UML model, both IEC 61850 and CIM
    (as demonstrated with the mixed sample buggy model in ./input/base-small.eap). However, you can
    filter per IEC working group which parts you actually want auto-generated from the model. This
    is supported by the new configuration option
    <code>docgen.xml.scope</code>
    , which works exactly the same way as the other scope options - this scope applies to XML doc
    generation only.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similar to MS Word document generation, XML document generation requires configuration for
    output files (schema name does not need be configured, it is found automatically), with the two
    new options:
    <code>docgen.xml.outSpec</code>
    holds the name of the instance file for the normative content (specification), and
    <code>docgen.xml.outDoc</code>
    is the name of the instance file with translatable content.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><b>Important:</b> </em> In this initial release, MS Word and XML doc generation are mutually
    exclusive. In other words, you have to provide <em>either</em> the MS Word file names <em>or</em>
    XML file names through configuration options. If required, in some future release, we may
    support generation of it all. However, the time required for MS Word doc generation is huge
    (minutes or tenths of minutes) as compared to XML doc generation (seconds).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><b>Known issue:</b> </em> Generated path for diagrams is wrong; this will be fixed in the
    next release.
  </p>
  <h4>Potential backwards compatibility breaking changes for the application user</h4>
  <p>In this release, these are mainly related to configuration options. We had to do heavy
    refactoring of existing code to support XML document generation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>config, model.builder.ea: added configuration option <code>model.picsRelpath</code> to
      specify relative path under which to save diagrams exported from UML, in case document
      generation is enabled. Since 01v06, default has changed from the user temporary directory to
      the projects output/pics/ directory; you can specify relative path for the directory of your
      choice. If doc generation is with an .xml output file, pics are not removed after exiting the
      application.
    </li>
    <li>config: renamed 5 MS Word-specific docgen options, by inserting ".word". This exercise
      is to clearly split what is specific to MS Word docgen as opposed to XML docgen, or common
      docgen options. New names are: <code>

      </code>, <code>
        docgen<b>.word.useFormatting</b>
      </code>, <code>

    <li>config: moved IEC 61850-specific configuration options to separate file
      (config/config61850.properties), to remove clutter of almost static options from the main
      configuration file.</li>
    <li>IEC 61850-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>config, docgen.collector: renamed configuration option <code>validation.iec61850.packageDoAbbr</code>
          to plural form <code>
            validation.iec61850.package<b>s</b>DoAbbr
          </code> and added support for multiple DO abbreviation packages; this is to support IEC
          61850-7-410 and IEC 61850-7-420 which also have DO abbreviations.
        </li>
        <li>config, docgen.collector: replaced configuration option <code>validation.iec61850.packagesExtTitle</code>
          with two options: <code>validation.iec61850.packagesLn</code> and <code>validation.iec61850.packagesCdc</code>,
          to eliminate hard-coded package names for LN and CDC packages, that require special
          formatting for titles.
        </li>
        <li>config, docgen.collector: removed configuration option <code>docgen.orderCaseInsensitive</code>.
          The original IEC 61850-7-4 abbreviations, and data semantic tables in both IEC 61850-7-4
          and IEC 61850-7-3 were using case-insensitive ordering. However, with the standard string
          processing by software, case-insensitive ordering will give one entry for "A" and "a" (so,
          one will be "swallowed", because considered as duplicate).
        </li>
        <li>docgen.writer: renamed placeholder <code>startUmlEnumerations</code> to <code>startUmlSclEnums</code>.
        </li>
        <li>config, docgen.collector: replaced configuration option <code>validation.iec61850.packageAndClassFC</code>
          with two options: <code>validation.iec61850.packageFC</code> and <code>validation.iec61850.packageTrgOp</code>,
          to allow for special formatting of content from IEC 61850-7-2. The corresponding
          placeholders can now be placed into a heading.
        </li>
        <li>config, model: on UML model managers tutorial, we agreed to rename top level
          packages (per WG). Version classes in UML have also been renamed to reflect the new
          containing package name. jCleanCim now will correctly identify those NEW version classes
          and top level package names (and older models may not produce outputs you expect.)</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Performance deterioration in release 01v06 with Office 2010 and EA 9</h3>
  <p>Release 01v06 does not contain any code modifications relevant to interaction with MS Word
    or Enterprise Architect. However, more recent versions of these applications seem to deteriorate
    performance (unless it is influenced by some PC configuration change, applied automatically by
    the corporate IT, which I cannot influence).</p>

  <h4>Functional changes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>config/log4j.xml: logs are now stored in 2 files: jCleanCim-detailed.log for debugging
      purposes (this is what used to be the only log file before) and the jCleanCim.log for tracing
      a <i>single program execution</i>, that you as the application user can analyse; this one
      contains exactly the same logging output as the console. For model managers, this is also what
      you want to include in the UML model release.
    </li>
    <li>model, stats: added better support for tagged values. Model now returns map per tag
      name, each name being associated with the set of all the UML objects using it. Statistics now
      includes the tag names per nature/per owner, and we log (at DEBUG level) the details per tag
      name for all elements in the model.</li>
    <li>model, validation, docgen.collector: added support for new stereotype "deprecated".</li>
    <li>model: initialised all the implementations of UmlKind with machine-processable token to
      be used for XML doc generation.</li>
    <li>CIM-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>docgen.collector: slightly changed table layouts for attributes and association
          ends, as agreed with the CIM model managers board; same layouts will be used for both
          information model and profiles documentation.</li>
        <li>docgen.collector: added support for printing attribute initial value in case it is
          a default, for the needs of dynamics package.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IEC61850-specific:
      <ul>
        <li>config, docgen.collector: added new configuration options <code>validation.iec61850.packagesDa</code>,
          to avoid hard-coded package name.
        </li>
        <li>config, docgen.collector: added new configuration option <code>validation.iec61850.packagesBasic</code>,
          to allow for printing basic (core) types from IEC 61850-7-2.
        </li>
        <li>docgen.collector: added new table layout specific to 61850 association ends.</li>
        <li>model: added support to recognise arguments for class constraints (presence
          conditions).</li>
        <li>model, docgen.collector: added support for attributes 'tissuesApplied' and
          'umlVersion' for namespace classes.</li>
        <li>config61850.properties: added static configuration parameters to support doc
          generation for IEC 61400-25-2, assuming the relevant packages will end with "_25_2".</li>
        <li>config.properties: added (commented) proposed configuration parameters to support
          doc generation for IEC 61400-25-2.</li>

  <h4>
    <a id="saveReopen">Performance improvements in release 01v05</a>
  </h4>
  <p>
    In release 01v05, we have changed the implementation in many places to optimise for performance.
    <b><i>Most significant improvements can be achieved when using the new configuration
        option: <code>docgen.saveReopenEvery</code>
    </i> </b> . This option sets the number of tables we generate before we close and reopen the MS Word
    auto-generated document. The action of closing and reopening the document seems to reset
    something in the "counting memory" of MS Word, so that we can obtain significant speed
    improvement. Time to save and reopen file takes in our environment between 1.2-7.7 minutes
    (maximum is for IEC61970-301 that is the largest document generated). If
    <code>docgen.saveReopenEvery</code>
    is too low, it will slow down the generation of the first ~200 tables, when inserting captions
    is fast. If it is too high, the MS Word "counting memory" when inserting captions grows
    exponentially and destroys performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The config.properties file contains values for
    <code>docgen.saveReopenEvery</code>
    which have been proven to be close to the optimum per file tested in our environment, but you
    can try to slightly increase/decrease that number to see the impact.

  <h4>Changes in release 01v05</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>potential backwards compatibility breaking changes for the application user:
      <ul>
        <li>running/developping with eclipse: now using eclipse-3.7 (indigo), but we have
          noticed no problems at all</li>
        <li>building with ant (in case you changed the original build.xml): now using ant-1.8.2
          (also bundled with eclipse-3.7); we have noticed no problems at all</li>
        <li>config: renamed IEC61850-specific docgen option <code>docgen.includeInheritanceFromMetamodel</code>
          to <code>docgen.iec61850.includeMetamodelInheritance</code></li>
        <li>model, docgen: EA does not export anymore any diagram that is under any package
          with name "DetailedDiagrams", because these diagrams are never meant to be used
          placeholders and are never printed (speed gain when reading model!)</li>
        <li>model, docgen: as agreed with CIM model managers, we reserve the prefix "Doc" for a
          package Doc[AnyName] under package [AnyName] to hold diagrams used in examples in the MS
          Word template, but that should not be printed in the actual UML model description in
          Clause 6 of CIM-based standards. If you have a model that contains such a package, it will
          not be printed when generating documentation. However, you can use its name to put in a
          placeholder anywhere in the MS Word template.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>non-functional changes (improvements):
      <ul>
        <li>builder.ea: replaced usage of clipboard for diagrams with file system. This means
          that the clipboard is "busy" only during model loading when docgen is enabled, instead of
          during the lengthy doc generation. Currently, the diagrams are saved as temporary files in
          the default temporary directory (differs between WinXP and Win7), and deleted upon
          jCleanCim exit; in a future release, the diagram files may be saved under output
          directory, and kept there for XML/HTML doc generation.</li>
        <li>docgen: decreased memory usage during docgen about 3-4 times (depending on what
          gets printed)</li>
        <li>builder.ea: significant improvement of speed, especially for models with lots of
          documentation, and when docgen is disabled (due to skipping diagrams export)</li>
        <li>docgen: significant improvement of speed, especially for large documents</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>functional changes:
      <ul>
        <li>application: added command line option <code>-version</code> to only print the
          application and JRE version information and exit
        </li>
        <li>config, docgen: added configuration option <code>docgen.saveReopenEvery</code> to
          speed up MS Word generation process
        </li>
        <li>builder: added support to retain diagrams from elements in a package that are
          otherwise skipped (such as statecharts) [wg10-0241]</li>
        <li>CIM-specific:
          <ul>
            <li>config: renamed model configuration option <code>profiles.dirname</code> to <code>
                profiles.dirname<b>s</b>
              </code> to allow for filtering/combination of profiles sub-directories (similar to what we
              already do with <code>validation.scope</code>)
            </li>
            <li>config: added property <code>profiles.relpath</code>, as relative path for
              profiles directories from <code>profiles.dirnames</code></li>
            <li>builder.xsd: now packaging sample profiles under ./input/profiles directory</li>
            <li>builder.xsd: <i>just started</i> adding support for building in-memory model
              from multiple XSD profiles
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>IEC61850-specific:
          <ul>
            <li>docgen: added new configuration option <code>docgen.iec61850.writeUmlTypes</code>,
              to allow for printing real types from UML, as they are, without processing required
              for official documents; this is useful for debugging only
            </li>
            <li>docgen: for all ENUMERATED and CODED ENUM attributes, and for ENS/ENC/ENG data
              objects, now printing actual (primitive) enumerated type name - the one ending with
              "Kind"</li>
            <li>docgen: removed printing "1" for multi-instance DOs, as this is not applicable
              anymore, with the new presence conditions [wg10-0178]</li>
            <li>docgen: temporarily printing presence conditions description before LN/CDC/DA
              tables to facilitate moving from old to new presence condition names</li>
            <li>docgen: started adding support for WebAccess XML generation</li>
          </ul>

    </li>
    <li>bug fixes:
      <ul>
        <li>docgen: fixed regression bug from 01v04 where output directory in a fresh
          installation directory was wrongly created under ./null/output instead of ./output</li>
        <li>application, config: fixed NPE when running jCleanCim with option -help</li>
        <li>application, run.bat: added possibility to specify command line arguments to <code>run</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>implementation and packaging:
      <ul>
        <li>builder: isolated classes specific to EA and XSD builders into sub-packages <code>ea</code>
          and <code>xsd</code>, respectively
        </li>
        <li>builder.ea: replaced all EA for-each iterations with GetAt(), and added check for
          collection size, to avoid round-trips to underlying RDBMS</li>
        <li>builder.ea: replaced EA calls that return raw and HTML doc by EaNotesCleaner class,
          and significantly improved performance for model building from EA (in particular, for HTML
          reading)</li>
        <li>model: renamed package <code>eamodel</code> to <code>model</code>, as it is
          independent of EA (still, some names in enums and such are those specific to EA, but this
          will be refactored in some future release)
        </li>
        <li>model, statistics: moved some logging methods from model to statistics</li>
        <li>xml: added new package <code>xml</code> containing facade to dom4j - this is in
          preparation for XML processing: input from XSD profiles and output for XML documentation
        </li>
        <li>docgen: added sub-package <code>xml61850</code> for creation of IEC61850 namespace
          description as XML
        </li>
        <li>docgen: Made explicit separation of doc collecting (independent of the format) from
          doc generation through Writer interface and WriterFactory class and arranged other classes
          into two new sub-packages: <code>collector</code> and <code>writer</code>. Note that doc
          collecting and writing were always separate steps by design, but generation called
          explicitly MSWordWriter constructor; this is now isolated through WriterFactory, which
          calls corresponding Writer implementation, based on output file format, specified in
          configuration.
        </li>
        <li>docgen: refactored to interfaces (Cursor, Range, etc.) the doc writing, with
          MSWord-specific implementation</li>
        <li>docgen.word: completely reimplemented table generation (for speed)</li>
        <li>docgen.word: now inserting diagram from file instead of from clipboard - it's
          faster</li>
        <li>updated UmlGraph.jar to version 5.4</li>
        <li>updated Jacob libraries to 1.15-M4</li>
        <li>updated commons-cli library to 1.2</li>
        <li>updated junit library to 8.2</li>
        <li>added dependency apache-lang3 library - used for HTML escaping and for time
          tracking</li>
        <li>added two more dependencies - dom4j and jaxen (only if XPath used through dom4j);
          planned for use for CIM profile-related features to come, and for 61850-to-XML for
          WebAccess</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>documentation:
      <ul>
        <li>added more hints related to performance</li>
        <li>added hyperlinks with TOC</li>

  <ul>
    <li>backwards compatibility breaking changes for the application user (note: those for
      potential application developer have not been tracked, because of massive refactorings in
      almost all packages). They involve changes in some property names (keys) defined in
      configuration file. <i>If you want to reuse your existing configuration properties file
        from previous releases of jCleanCim, ensure you rename the properties as indicated here:</i>
      <ul>
        <li>config: configuration property names have changed for <code>model</code> (now <code>
            model<b>.filename</b>
          </code>) and <code>nonCimNature</code> (now <code>
            <b>model.nature.iec61850</b>
          </code>). These two properties have always been at the very top of the default config.properties
          file provided with any jCleanCim distribution. <i>Rationale</i>: Very short proprety name
          (key) is not a good key, and difficult to distinguish in the code (e.g., searching for
          word "model" gives hundreds of hits, while search for "model.filename" gives what is
          actually needed).
        </li>
        <li>config: configuration property names have changed for all 7 <code>validation.[].on</code>
          properties (now <code>
            validation.[].<b>off</b>
          </code>). <i>Rationale</i>: By adding functionality to filter individual rules for validation
          (see below), it is more obvious to have the defaults that do full validation of everything
          and let the user describe "exceptions", i.e., what to skip. With this change, the full
          validation is enabled by default (even if properties are not defined in the configuration
          file at all), and you need to specify only what you want to disable.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>functional changes:
      <ul>
        <li>main, builder, docgen: now logging versions of software used: EA, MS Word,
          jCleanCim and jvm/OS</li>
        <li>all: logging preserves order (=deterministic, for easier comparison)</li>
        <li>model, docgen: added support for HTML (formatted) descriptions for all UML
          elements; however, HTML-based formatting still does not work properly in Word</li>
        <li>config, docgen: added configuration option <code>docgen.useFormatting</code> to use
          or ignore HTML when writing to MS Word (default: false)
        </li>
        <li>statistics: now showing also the number of informative elements (if any) per scope
          - thanks to Eric Lambert (ERDF) for this idea, the feature shows extremely useful for
          model management</li>
        <li>docgen: added support to add custom properties to the auto-generated MS Word
          document: uml=model-file-name, jCleanCim=version-number [wg10-0004]</li>
        <li>config: all the description of configuration options has been moved from
          config.properties file into the code (class <code>org.tanjakostic.jcleancim.common.Config</code>),
          and the documentation of those options is now available as hyperlinked javadoc in <code>doc/api/index.html</code>
          for all distributions, and also in <code>doc/jCleanCim-[version].pdf</code> file in the
          binary distribution
        </li>
        <li>config: added configuration option <code>validation.rules.off</code> to
          individually disable validation rules
        </li>
        <li>CIM-specific:
          <ul>
            <li>docgen: removed placeholder "startUmlDocPackage"; that was used in older
              versions of IEC 61970-301 to display package doc only, but was considered as redundant
              and is not required anymore (approved by model managers)</li>
            <li>model: removed support for stereotype ExtensionPoint (was temporarily used in
              IEC61968)</li>
            <li>config: added configuration option for new functionality: <code>profiles.crosscheck.on</code>;
              <i> however, the functionality has still not been implemented</i></li>
            <li>config: added configuration option for new functionality: <code>profiles.docgen.on</code>;
              <i>however, the functionality has still not been implemented</i></li>
            <li>config: added model configuration option <code>profiles.dirname</code> for
              telling where the profiles are (from which to cross-check with UML or to generate Word
              doc); <i>however, the functionality has still not been implemented</i></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>IEC61850-specific:
          <ul>
            <li>docgen: added configuration option to ignore case for alphabetic sorting (used
              for data semantic tables in 7-4/7-3)</li>
            <li>docgen: added support for table name for LNs, CDCs, DAs and enums [wg10-0031]</li>
            <li>config: added configuration options to distinguish -7-2 part of the model and
              the meta-model</li>
            <li>docgen: for DA headings (7-3), added indication for enum or coded enum</li>
            <li>docgen: display conditions immediately before the LN table [wg10-0044]</li>
            <li>docgen: added type column to DataSemantic table [wg10-0103]</li>
            <li>model, docgen: added support for <code>moveAfter</code> tag for attributes to
              allow for reordering of tagged CDC attributes
            </li>
            <li>model, docgen: added support for <code>scl:emptyValue</code> tag for literals
              to allow for printing empty value in case the literal is "none" [wg10-0167]
            </li>
            <li>docgen: produce one row for FCDAs with fc= SG and SE, remove "_" from name</li>
            <li>docgen: do not print FCDAs with fc= SG and SE in data semantic table</li>
          </ul>

          thanks to Dianne Heath (Siemens) for reporting the problem and helping to identify its
          source</li>
        <li>(IEC61850) docgen: coded enums now get printed as "CODED ENUM" instead of
          "ENUMERATION"</li>
        <li>(IEC61850) docgen: added 3 NBSP in LN group titles [wg10-0008]</li>
        <li>(IEC61850) docgen: added 3 NBSP in LN titles [wg10-0009]</li>
        <li>(IEC61850) model: fixed wrong grouping of transient ACT LN attributes under Control
          category, instead of SPC transient LN attributes [wg10-0027]</li>
        <li>(IEC61850) model: fixed order of LN attribute groups to fit the last-minute changes
          in IEC61850-7-4 [wg10-0028]</li>
        <li>(IEC61850) docgen: fixed NPE when config option
          validation.iec61850.packageAndClassFC absent</li>
        <li>(IEC61850) docgen: changed column name for LN tables from "Description" to
          "Explanation" [wg10-0032]</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>implementation and packaging:
      <ul>
        <li>common: consolidated app flow logging and duration printing</li>
        <li>common: added support to execute with no .eap model (to allow for fast testing by
          building the tiny in-memory models by hand, and in anticipation of support for profile MS
          Word templates into which to include the doc read from profiles generated by CIMTool); the
          program flow is ok (no NPE), it's just that there is nothing to validate, collect
          statistics on, or to write to MS Word</li>
        <li>model: added support for UUID and alias to UmlObject</li>
        <li>model: added new data structure (UmlObjectData) and refactored all ctors of
          concrete UmlObject-s to use it</li>
        <li>model: added support for multiple stereotypes</li>
        <li>model: refactored to builder + model pattern, to allow for creation of in-memory
          model in different ways (to prepare for creation of the profile models) and for fast
          testing without EA file (finally!)</li>
        <li>model: added lots of tests</li>
        <li>validation: heavilly refactored validators and rules; simplified generics and
          reduced lot of duplication by providing abstract generic implementation for rules common
          to several subtypes of UmlObject-s (like for tagged values, documentation, names,
          stereotypes)</li>
        <li>docgen: extracted interfaces for figure (diagram) and containers (package and
          class) docs</li>
        <li>docgen: refactored a lot, to allow for formatting</li>
        <li>model, docgen: replaced usage of clipboard for diagrams with saving to tmp files
          (only when docgen.on=true)</li>
        <li>ant, run.bat: removed version information from the name of jCleanCim jar, to avoid
          the need to update the script every time; jar is now always called jCleanCim.jar</li>
        <li>ant: externalised application version into config/build.properties for ease of
          maintenance and to allow application to fetch its version information even when built from
          within eclipse and without ant build script</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>documentation:
      <ul>
        <li>updated performance measurements without anti-virus scan-on-access</li>
        <li>updated the presentation</li>

  <ul>
    <li>functional (impacting official IEC documents):
      <ul>
        <li>docgen: added border to tables in generated doc (with Word 2007, rendering on the
          screen made it obvious that some tables were without any border; with Word 2003, this was
          not obvious)</li>
        <li>(CIM) model: added support for CIMDatatype stereotype; still keeping support for

            <li>ClassesWithSuperclassesFromUnallowedPackage</li>
            <li>DependenciesWithUnallowedDirection</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(implementation) moved association ownership calculation from UmlAssociation to
          OwningWg, and added method that returns "legal" dependencies among WGs top-level packages
          (so this kind of calculation is all in one place)</li>
        <li>improved NPE handling in several places</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>documentation/build flexibility:

        <li>elcipse-specific zip distribution (-eclipse.zip) is now exported as eclipse project
          archive and can be imported as project form this archive; it now also contains default
          launch configuration (reading model name and properties from default config.properties
          file)</li>
        <li>added ant build file to automate creating binary (-bin.zip) and source (-src.zip)
          distributions independent of eclipse</li>
        <li>added (in ant build) automatic creation of UML within javadoc</li>
        <li>added (in ant build) automatic creation of pdf javadoc for -bin.zip distribution</li>
        <li>added (in ant build) automatic creation of pdf page documenting ant targets
          dependencies for -src.zip distribution</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>rebranded name to start with lower case letter</li>
